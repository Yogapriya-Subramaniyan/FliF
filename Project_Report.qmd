## Introduction

## Research Question

1.  Where is the root of FliF located
2.  Where are the outgroups (non-flagellar T3SS) occur with respect to the root
3.  Is it similar to MotAB – Motor proteins -

## Methods

### Collection of sequences

1.  Collect all protein sequences as fasta from various genomes script

### Homolog protein Identification

2.  Using precalculated profiles of FliF, use JackHMMER (Hidden Markov Model) to find the distant relatives
3.  Or use Jackhmmer to build a profile (from various starting points) Pfam (Protein Family)– provides precalculated profiles PSSM(Point Specific Scoring matrix) – a statistical of protein family
